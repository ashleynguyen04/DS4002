**How to obtain the data:**

1) Download the reviews data zipfile (Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0) from: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
2) Download the movie metadata zipfile (title.basics.tsv.gz) from: https://datasets.imdbws.com/
3) Extract the title.basics.tsv from the zip file (don't need to unzip the reviews data as the dataset creation pipeline in the scripts folder will do this for you)
4) Open up the scripts code
5) Upload both files from your local device to your Colab content folder 
6) Run the dataset creation pipeline from the scripts folder (make sure the path length for the 2 datasets you uploaded to Colab is correct, can c+p the path name from the content folder on the left)
